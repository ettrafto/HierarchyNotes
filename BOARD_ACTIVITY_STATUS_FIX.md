# Board Activity Status Fix - Implementation Summary

## The Problem

When closing a note using the **X button** in the note window, the Board UI was **not reflecting the inactive status**. The state was being updated in the store, but the UI components weren't displaying it.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue #1: State Was Being Updated Correctly
The `markNoteClosedFromOS` function in the store **was correctly** setting `isActive: false` after my initial fix.

### Issue #2: UI Components Weren't Using `isActive`
The Board UI components (NotesList and NoteGhosts) were **only displaying `isOpen` status**, not `isActive` status:
- **NotesList**: Only showed open (●) vs closed (○) indicator
- **NoteGhosts**: Only used `isOpen` to determine visual styling (green border vs gray dashed)

The user expected to SEE that a note was "inactive" on the Board, but there was no UI representation for this state!

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced NotesList Component (`src/components/Board/NotesList.tsx`)

**Added visual indicators for inactive notes:**

```tsx
// Title fades out when inactive
<span 
  className="truncate" 
  style={{ opacity: n.isActive === false ? 0.5 : 1 }}
>
  {n.title || 'Untitled'}
</span>

// Red "inactive" badge appears
{n.isActive === false && (
  <span className="text-[10px] px-1 py-0.5 bg-red-900/30 text-red-400 rounded">
    inactive
  </span>
)}
```

**Visual Changes:**
- ✅ Inactive note titles appear **faded (50% opacity)**
- ✅ Red **"inactive"** badge appears next to the title
- ✅ Open/closed indicator (●/○) still shows independently

### 2. Enhanced NoteGhosts Component (`src/components/Board/NoteGhosts.tsx`)

**Added `isActive` prop to Ghost component:**
```tsx
<Ghost 
  key={n.id} 
  noteId={n.id} 
  title={n.title} 
  rect={n.rect} 
  isOpen={!!n.isOpen} 
  isActive={n.isActive !== false}  // ← NEW
  scale={scale} 
/>
```

**Updated styling to show inactive state:**
```tsx
// Inactive notes get special red-tinted styling
if (!isActive) {
  borderStyle = '1.5px dashed #ef4444';     // Red dashed border
  bgColor = 'rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.08)';       // Red tinted background
  boxShadow = 'none';                         // No glow
  titleOpacity = 0.5;                         // Faded title
}
```

**Title label includes [INACTIVE] marker:**
```tsx
{title || 'Untitled'}{!isActive && ' [INACTIVE]'}
```

**Visual Changes:**
- ✅ Inactive notes have **red dashed border** (instead of green/gray)
- ✅ Inactive notes have **red-tinted background**
- ✅ Title shows **[INACTIVE]** suffix
- ✅ Title appears **faded (50% opacity)**
- ✅ No glow effect

### 3. Enhanced Logging (`src/app/store.ts`)

**Added comprehensive logging to `markNoteClosedFromOS`:**
```typescript
markNoteClosedFromOS: (id: ID) => {
  set((state) => {
    if (state.notes[id]) {
      const note = state.notes[id];
      console.log('[Store] markNoteClosedFromOS BEFORE:', {
        id, title: note.title, isOpen: note.isOpen, isActive: note.isActive,
      });
      
      note.isOpen = false;
      note.isActive = false;
      
      console.log('[Store] markNoteClosedFromOS AFTER:', {
        id, title: note.title, isOpen: note.isOpen, isActive: note.isActive,
      });
    }
  });
},
```

## How It Works Now

### When You Close a Note with X Button:

1. **User clicks X** → `handleClose()` in NoteShell
2. **IPC call** → `closeNoteWindow({ id })`
3. **Tauri closes window** → Window destroyed
4. **Rust emits event** → `note:closed` sent to Board
5. **Board receives event** → Calls `markNoteClosedFromOS(id)`
6. **Store updated** → Sets `isOpen: false`, `isActive: false`
7. **UI re-renders** → NotesList and NoteGhosts detect change
8. **Visual feedback** → Note appears inactive with red styling

### Visual States

| State | isOpen | isActive | NotesList Display | Ghost Display |
|-------|--------|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Active & Open** | ✅ true | ✅ true | ● (filled dot) | Green solid border, glowing |
| **Active & Closed** | ❌ false | ✅ true | ○ (empty dot) | Gray dashed border |
| **Inactive & Closed** | ❌ false | ❌ false | ○ + "inactive" badge + faded | **Red dashed border + [INACTIVE]** |
| **Inactive & Open** | ✅ true | ❌ false | ● + "inactive" badge + faded | **Red dashed border + [INACTIVE]** |

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Open a note window
```
1. Start the app: npm run tauri dev
2. Create or open a note from the Board
```

### 2. Close using X button
```
1. Click the X button on the note window
2. Watch the console for logs
3. Check the Board UI
```

### 3. Verify Visual Changes

**In NotesList (left sidebar):**
- ✅ Note title appears **faded** (50% opacity)
- ✅ Red **"inactive"** badge appears
- ✅ Open/closed indicator changes from ● to ○

**In Board Canvas (NoteGhosts):**
- ✅ Note border changes from **green/cyan solid** to **red dashed**
- ✅ Background changes to **red tint**
- ✅ Title shows **[INACTIVE]** suffix
- ✅ Title appears **faded**
- ✅ Glow effect disappears

### 4. Check Console Output

When closing a note, you should see:
```
[NoteShell] Close button clicked
[Store] markNoteClosedFromOS BEFORE: { id: 'note-abc123', title: 'My Note', isOpen: true, isActive: true }
[Store] markNoteClosedFromOS AFTER: { id: 'note-abc123', title: 'My Note', isOpen: false, isActive: false }
```

### 5. Reopen the note

```
1. Click on the inactive note in the Board canvas
2. Note should reopen
3. isActive should become true again
4. Visual styling should return to normal (green border)
```

## Files Modified

1. **src/components/Board/NotesList.tsx**
   - Added opacity fade for inactive notes
   - Added red "inactive" badge

2. **src/components/Board/NoteGhosts.tsx**
   - Added `isActive` prop to Ghost component
   - Added red dashed border styling for inactive notes
   - Added [INACTIVE] label to title
   - Added title opacity fade

3. **src/app/store.ts**
   - Enhanced logging in `markNoteClosedFromOS`
   - Logs BEFORE and AFTER state changes

## Visual Comparison

### Before Fix
- ❌ Closing a note only changed open (●) to closed (○)
- ❌ No visual indication of "inactive" status
- ❌ User couldn't tell if closing set the note to inactive

### After Fix
- ✅ Closing shows clear "inactive" badge in sidebar
- ✅ Board canvas shows red dashed border + [INACTIVE] label
- ✅ All inactive notes are immediately visually distinct
- ✅ User can clearly see the activity status

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Add tooltip** - Hover over inactive note to show "This note is inactive. Click to reactivate."
2. **Bulk operations** - Add "Deactivate All" / "Activate All" buttons
3. **Filter by status** - Add filter toggle in NotesList: "Show Active Only"
4. **Keyboard shortcut** - Add Ctrl+D to toggle active/inactive for selected notes
5. **Persistent state** - Ensure `isActive` persists correctly across app restarts (already handled by debouncedPersist)

---

**Status:** ✅ Complete - Board UI now correctly reflects inactive status
**Build Status:** ✅ Passing (no errors)
**Visual Feedback:** ✅ Clear indicators in both sidebar and canvas
